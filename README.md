# About me 👋 
- I love writing software to tackle complex mathematical problems 🧮
- I like coding challenges and optimizing my Linux setup 🔭
- When I'm not coding I'm climbing, hiking or riding my bike 🏔️

I use Python and Matlab to write scientific code, and when I need a do-it-all _loosey-goosey_ language.
For various reasons, I like to use Linux, know the basics of Bash and GNU coreutils.
I have used C\# in the past but I have tried Go and would like to properly learn it 🌱
